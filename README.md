### Introduction
mmWaveMatlab is a Matlab codebase for millimeter wave radar signal processing and human sensing. This document will introduce some of the main features of mmWaveMatlab and show corresponding results.

### Basic Signal Processing
This category provides basic range, velocity, and angle measurements.

#### Range Measurement
Perform Range FFT and obtain range point clouds through 1D CFAR.


#### Velocity Measurement
Perform Doppler FFT and obtain RD point clouds through 2D CFAR.


#### Angle Measurement
Configure the antenna array and perform angle estimation algorithms (FFT or digital beamforming) to obtain range-angle maps and range-angle point clouds. Digital beamforming supports CBF and Capon algorithms and provides signal reconstruction.
